#!/bin/zsh

# In order to run a script, you must provide the proper access to the system.

# The command "chmod 744 [file name]" will allow the system to execute the script.

# Once that is done, you can execute a script by calling the full pathname of the file.

# For example, to call this script, run:
# /Users/JRDN/Documents/Coding/Shell/4.0_Learning/1.0_Introduction/1.1_Running-Scripts.zsh

echo Script has been called!
