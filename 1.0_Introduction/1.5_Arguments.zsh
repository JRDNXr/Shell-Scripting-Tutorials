# We can use arguments in our scripts as well.

# Just before you run this script, add text to the end of the script.

# For example, copy and paste this line:
# /Users/JRDN/Documents/Coding/Shell/4.0_Learning/1.0_Introduction/1.5_Arguments.zsh Arguments-are-cool!

echo $1


# We can utilize arguments to do things in our scripts.

# You can also use as many arguments as you'd like.


# /Users/JRDN/Documents/Coding/Shell/4.0_Learning/1.0_Introduction/1.5_Arguments.zsh Arguments-are-cool! The-1st-arg The-2nd-arg

echo "\n"$2

echo "\n"$3


# As we increase the number of arguments, we must also increase the nth value. The arguments are passed at the time
